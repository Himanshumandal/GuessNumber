# GuessNumber
A number-guessing game in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves a simple interface where users input a guess. The HTML structures the game with an input field, a button, and a message display area. CSS styles the game, making it visually appealing with centered content and a clean design. JavaScript handles the game logic.
